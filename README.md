The Mellow Yellow Fellow game is a currently 'unfinished' replica of an existing game.  Using the provided Unity project as a starting point, enhance the game to include multiple new features:

The game should include multiple Ghosts, each with a slightly different 'personality'.
The Fellow and the Ghosts should be able to use the tunnel at the sides of the game arena to 'teleport' from side to side.
Ghosts should return to the centre of the maze to be restored after having been 'eaten' by a powered-up Fellow.
The player should have multiple lives, with the game resetting the location of the Fellow and Ghosts at the start of each 'life'.
Rather than ending, the game should reset, allowing the player to complete a new 'level'.
The game should have a user interface, informing the player of the current score, best high score,  life count, current level, and so on.
New high scores should be managed, so that they can be saved for later plays of the game.
